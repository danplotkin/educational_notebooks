# Understanding Reinforcement Learning


## About
Welcome to my course *Understanding Reinforcement Learning*! This course will be split up into two parts:
* Part I: Mastering Reinforcement Learning Conceptually
* Part II: Implementing Reiforcement Learning in Python (*Not yet published*)

By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding on what reinforcement learning is, the mathematical foundation of reiforcement learning, Mardov Decision Process (MDP), Q-learning, Deep-Q Learning, and how you can implement all of these skills using python in a real world project!
