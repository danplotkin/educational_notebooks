## About

In this notebook, we will talk about the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning, we will talk about the architecture of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the algorithms to train one, and some of the challenges in Deep Learning training.

## Prerequisits

This notebook requires you understand:

1) How to write basic Python.
2) Basic Machine Learning (ML) Concepts:
     - Train vs Validation vs Test set
     - What is supervised learning?
     - What are the use-cases for ML?
3) Understanding basic Calculus and/or Linear Algebra is a plus.
